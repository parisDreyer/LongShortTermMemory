# LongShortTermMemory
This is a basic long-short-term-memory neural-network code example I wrote in the C# standard library
I wrote this in order to better understand LSTM Neural Networks

There is no GPU processing because I didn't have a GPU at the time that I wrote this, LOL

It would easy to add GPU, Object Serialization, and a Windows-Form UI, although most LSTM stuff can be done really effectively with KERAS and TensorFlow APIs

I hope this code example can be instructive to people who are interested in learning a little more about how LSTMs work!

Please let me know if there are any errors and I will be sure to fix them! I am always happy to learn more.

Thanks for looking!
